# Liver-Patient-Analysis
Liver disease averts the normal function of the liver. Mainly due to the large amount of alcohol consumption liver diseasearises. Early prediction of liver disease using classification algorithms in an effacious task that can help the doctors to diagnoise the disease within a short duration of time.Discovering the existence of liver disease at an early stage is a complex task for the doctors. The main objective of the paper is to analyze the parameters of classification algorithms and compare their predictive accuracies so as to find out the best classifier for determining the liver disease.This paper focuses on the related works of various authors on liver disease such that algorithms where implemented using Weka tool that is a machine learning software written in Java.Various attributes that are essential in prediction of liver disease were examined in the dataset to liver patients where also evaluated.The paper compares various classification algorithms such as Random Forest,Logistic Regression and seperation Algorithm with an aim to identify the best technique based on this study. Random forest with the highest accuracy outperformed the other algorithms and can be further utilized in the prediction of liver disease commended.
