# Liver-Patient-Analysis
Liver disease averts the normal function of the liver. Mainly due to the large amount of alcohol consumption liver diseasearises. Early prediction of liver disease using classification algorithms in an effacious task that can help the doctors to diagnoise the disease within a short duration of time.Discovering the existence of liver disease at an early stage is a complex task for the doctors. The main objective of the paper is to analyze the parameters of classification algorithms and compare their predictive accuracies so as to find out the best classifier for determining the liver disease.
